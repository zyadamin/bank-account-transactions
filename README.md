# bank-account-transactions

Consider a bank teller who’s responsible for account transactions up to 20 bank customers. You’ll be required to enter actions on account in last month (max 10 transactions). Transactions will be either withdraw (with W letter) or Deposit (with D letter).
At first you’ll enter a customer name, address and transactions.
- Address should follow the format number, street name, neighborhood, city. And if user entered incorrectly he/she have to re-enter again.
- Entered transaction should be valid (no negative transactions). And if one of the transactions was wrong, user needs to re-enter the invalid transaction
